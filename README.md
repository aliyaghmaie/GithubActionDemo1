Test Report: Interface Testing of Word Corners Game
GitHub Repository Link:
https://github.com/aliyaghmaie/GithubActionDemo1

Test Execution Overview:
Test Environment:
GitHub Actions Workflow: Selenium Test
Branch for Testing: main
Testing Framework: Selenium WebDriver with Python
Test Coverage: Moderately good, covering major user interactions.
Test Execution Procedure:
Setting Up the Test Environment:

The GitHub Actions Workflow named "Selenium Test" is configured to run on every push to the main branch.
The workflow checks out the repository, sets up the Python environment, installs dependencies, downloads ChromeDriver, and runs Selenium tests.
Test Execution:

The Selenium tests are executed against the Word Corners game interface using the test_script.py script in the selenium_tests directory.
Key interactions such as starting the game, entering words, and submitting them are automated to ensure the basic functionality of the game.
Cross-Test Theme View via GitHub Action:
The cross-test theme is covered in the main branch, ensuring that the GitHub Actions Workflow runs on the primary branch where the latest changes are merged. This helps catch any integration issues early in the development process.
Testing Framework:
Selenium WebDriver with Python is used for interface testing. It provides a reliable way to interact with web elements, simulate user actions, and verify expected behaviors.
Test Coverage Rating:
Rating: Good
Analysis: The existing tests cover the core functionalities of the Word Corners game, including starting the game and entering words. However, additional scenarios and edge cases could be considered for more comprehensive coverage.
Ideas for Additional Tests:
Game Progression Test:

Automate the progression of the game through multiple levels to ensure a smooth transition and functionality.
Error Handling Scenarios:

Test the game's behavior when encountering errors, such as entering invalid words or navigating to non-existent pages.
Performance Testing:

Evaluate the game's performance by simulating a large number of users interacting simultaneously.
Conclusion:
The interface testing of the Word Corners game has been successfully implemented using Selenium WebDriver. The current test coverage is good, focusing on essential user interactions. However, to enhance the testing strategy, additional scenarios and edge cases should be considered.
